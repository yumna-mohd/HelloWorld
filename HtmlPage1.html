        What is Html? <br /> <!--the tag <br> is used to insert a single line break-->
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        What is html markup? <br />
        HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types,
        character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like the heading tags, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired,
        for example the image tag. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
    </p>

    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>  <!--<h3> is the third heading out of the total 6 headings and is the comparatively smaller than both, the first and the second heading (h1 and h2) -->
    <p>
        What are html elements? <br />
        HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus
        In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
        and "end tag". The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
        Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text.
        This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.

    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>  <!--<h4> is the fourth heading out of the total 6 headings and is the comparatively smaller than the first, the second and the third heading (h1, h2 and h3) -->

        Heading in html. <br />
        HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading.
        The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.
    </p>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>  <!--<h5> is the second last heading and is smaller than all the former headings (h1, h2, h3 and h4)-->
    <p>
        What are html attributes? <br />
        HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type.
        An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax,
        an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.
    </p>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6> <!--<h6> is the last heading and is smaller than all the former headings (h1, h2, h3, h4 and h5)-->
    <p>
        Comments in html! <br />
        An HTML comment begins with <! –– and the comment closes with ––> . HTML comments are visible to anyone that views the page source code,
        but are not rendered when the HTML document is rendered by a browser.
